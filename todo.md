# Some Ideas

 * [x] When creating a new tab, default to it at the end
 * [ ] work out why the fuck markdown's always start folded!
 * [ ] add text object for comment block
 * [ ] tool to extract variable to const in go, should be placed at top of file after imports or end of other constants if exists
 * [ ] code action mapping `cf` fails in go
 * [x] update to latest nightly and use vim.opt
 * [ ] helper to create action, action in tab, action in v/h split mappings (see lsp config)
 * [x] update comment tool to take a count, see reddit dude who's used my plugin
 * [ ] move tests that are heavily setup to integrtation and out of unit
 * [x] use the floating window boarder that's built in
 * [ ] todo list handles <CR> but this is broke (test is correct) as overrides <CR> for completion, need a better way of handling this
 * [ ] use native float border: help nvim_open_win
 * [ ] check out the code lens built in stuff: help vim.lsp.codelens

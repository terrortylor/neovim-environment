# Vim Environment
I repository for my ~/.vim directory and ~/.vimrc file.
FYI, I've checked in my spelling file! And I can't spell very well at all!

# Plugins
Using the vim native package manager as of vim 8... so you need vim >=8

# Key Mappings
Checkout the `vimrc` file, most of is is commented.

## Noteworthy
Most of these are fairly standard when coming across other peoples `.vimrc` files on the line; but worth taking a minute to take a look just in case...
* Arrow keys have been disabled to try to prevent bad habits...
* The `<leader>` key is mapped to `\`
* `jj` has been mapped in `insert` mode to `<ESC` to save some hand movements
